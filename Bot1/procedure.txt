1. Login to your discord account
2. Create new server
3. Login to discord developers portal
4. Create a new Bot
5. Save its token
6. Go to OAuth. Click bot and necessary permissions
    (clicking Administrator would give the bot access to the server which is not suitable)
7. Copy the url and open it in new tab
8. Create a new repl in replit. Use the python language
9. import discord (repl will automatically install the packages)
    discord.py works on events. it gives callback function
